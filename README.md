# Low Power Modes on PIC® Microcontrollers
# Introduction
 The term " power down mode” refers to a condition in which a Microcontroller Unit (MCU) enters a low-power mode. The power down modes helps to reduce average power consumption of the MCU through effective management of CPU operations, clock signal to CPU and peripherals. The power down modes in PIC family of MCU’s typically comprises of Doze, Idle, Sleep and Deep sleep modes. The PIC18 Q10 family of MCU’s have three power down modes and they are Doze, Idle and Sleep mode. This example demonstrates configuration of Doze, Idle and Sleep power down modes in PIC18F47Q10 MCU, to achieve low power consumption.

# Power down modes - Theory
This section briefly discusses each of the power down mode available in PIC18 Q10 family.

**Doze mode:** In Doze mode CPU and memory operations are affected, but the peripheral clocks continue to run. Doze mode allows power saving by reducing CPU clock instruction cycle compared to the active mode, while leaving the peripherals clock unchanged. In Doze mode CPU executes only one instruction cycle out of every N-cycles as defined by the DOZE [2:0] bits in CPUDOZE register. For example, if DOZE [2:0] = 001, the instruction cycle ratio is 1:4. The CPU and memory execute for one instruction cycle and then lay idle for three instruction cycles. During the unused cycles, the peripherals continue to operate at the system clock speed.
Steps to enter the Doze mode:
1. CPUDOZEbits.DOZEN    = 1; //Doze enable bit (DOZEN) must be set, to enter the Doze mode.
2. CPUDOZEbits.DOZE[2:0]= 0bxxx; //Select the ratio of CPU clock instruction cycle to Peripheral             clock instruction cycle in DOZE register.
3. CPUDOZEbits.ROI          = 1; //Set the Recover-On-Interrupt bit to come out of the Doze mode, when              interrupt occurs.

**Idle mode:** In Idle mode CPU and Memory operations are halted, but the peripheral clocks continue to run. Device is put into the Idle mode by executing **SLEEP** instruction, when Idle enable bit (IDLEN=1) is set.

**Sleep mode:** Sleep mode turns OFF the system clock. The CPU and all peripherals requiring the system clock will cease operation. The contents of the memory and registers are maintained in the sleep mode. Device is put into the Sleep mode by executing **SLEEP** instruction, when Idle enable bit (IDEN=0) is clear.

# Clocks
This section discusses about System clock, CPU clock and Peripheral cock (Refer Table 1).

**System Clock:** System clock designated as FOSC is the main clock which can be supplied from external oscillators, quartz crystal resonators, ceramic resonators and Resistor-Capacitor (RC) circuits. In addition, the system clock source can be supplied from one of two internal oscillators. Oscillator module can be configured to select one of the clock sources.

**CPU Clock:** The instruction clock or CPU clock is derived from the system clock or FOSC through a divider to deliver an instruction clock of FOSC/4 (1/4 the oscillator speed). This is done to allow the fetch and execute pipeline in the architecture to execute one assembly instruction per instruction clock cycle (except for branches and goto's which execute in two). CPU clock is supplied to the CPU and memory to perform CPU and memory Operations in the application.

**Peripheral Clock:** Clock to different peripherals can be selected from various options such as FOSC i.e. the system clock, FOSC/4 (instruction clock or CPU clock), output of other peripherals, LFINTOSC, MFINTOSC, HFINTOSC or Timer overflow events etc.

*Table 1: Clock details in Power Down modes*

**Peripheral Module Disable:**

The Peripheral Module Disable (PMD) provides the ability to disable a peripheral module by stopping all clock sources supplied to that module. A peripheral can be disabled by setting the corresponding peripheral disable bit in the PMDx register.  All the peripherals are enabled by default. To reduce overall power consumption, the user can disable unused modules/Peripherals. Refer to the device data sheet for more details about the PMD register

# Demo Description

![block_diagram](images/block_diagram.jpg)

*Figure 1: Block diagram of application demo*  

  In this demo,
*    PIC18F47Q10 Curiosity Nano and Power debugger boards from Microchip are used to demonstrate power down modes configuration and to measure MCU power consumption.
*    The on-board mechanical switch (SW0) of PIC18F47Q10 Curiosity Nano board is used to invoke power down modes or to wake up the MCU from power down modes which happens sequentially at each switch press event.
*    The MCU operating mode (i.e. Active mode/Doze mode/Idle mode/Sleep mode) information is transmitted to the terminal window of Data visualizer tool, through virtual COM port of the Curiosity nano board.
*    The power debugger board measures the power consumption of the PIC18F47Q10 MCU and transmit it to the power analysis window of Data visualizer tool.
*    The onboard LED(LED0) is used as an indication while the MCU wakes up from any of the power down modes and enters the active mode.
*    Active mode: After power up, by default MCU operates in Active mode. To a switch press event the MCU performs EEPROM write and read operations. The power consumption of Curiosity Nano board in Active mode, can be viewed on power analysis window of the Data visualizer tool.
*   Doze mode: The MCU enters Doze mode to a switch press event and performs the EEPROM operation. In this mode CPU operates at reduced clock instruction cycles compared to the active mode. The MCU continue to be in Doze mode until a switch press event is detected. Upon a switch press event, the MCU wake up from Doze mode and enter Active mode. Then after the on-board LED turns ON indicating the MCU is in active mode.
*  	Idle mode: The MCU enters Idle mode to a switch press event. The MCU continue to be in Idle mode until a switch press event is detected. Upon a switch press event, the MCU wake up from the Idle mode and enter active mode. Then after the on-board LED turns ON indicating the MCU is in active mode.
*  Sleep mode: The MCU enters Sleep mode to a switch press event. The MCU continue to be in Sleep mode until a switch press event is detected. Upon a switch press event, the MCU wake up from the Sleep mode and enter active mode. Then after the on-board LED turns ON indicating the MCU is in active mode.

# Demo realization
## Peripherals Configuration using MCC
**System Configuration**

The system configuration window of MCC is used for MCU oscillator, PLL, Watchdog timer and low voltage programming configuration. Internal oscillator of 1MHz frequency with clock divider 1 is used as a system clock and the Watchdog timer is disabled in this example. Figure 4 shows the system configuration settings used in this example.

![system_configuration](images/system_configuration.jpg)

*Figure 4: System Configuration*

**EUSART2 Configuration**

In this demo EUSART2 is used to transmit data on the terminal window to display the device mode of operation (i.e. active/doze/idle/sleep). Figure 5 shows the EUSART2 module configuration settings.
Configurations to be done on EUSART2 peripheral:
* Check the Enable EUSART checkbox.
* Check the Enable Transmit checkbox.
* Set the Baud Rate to 9600.
* Check the Redirect STDIO to USART.

![esuart2](images/esuart2.jpg)

*Figure 5: EUSART2 Configuration*

**Pin Module**

The I/O pin mapping of the PIC18F47Q10 MCU for EUSART2 interface and Curiosity Nano on board LED is shown in the figure 6.

# Conclusion
This example demonstrates the configuration of various power down modes available in PIC18 Q10 MCUs. As demonstrated in the example, EEPROM Write and Read operations takes more current in Active mode as compared to Doze mode. In Doze mode current consumption depends upon the doze ratio selected. In PIC18 Q10 MCUs, Sleep mode is the lowest current mode where the MCU power consumption is minimum, as clock is disabled to CPU and all the other peripherals.
